## Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

---

## 📌 Introduction

Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from digital attacks.  
The primary goal of cyber security is to ensure that information remains **secure, accurate, and available only to authorized users**.

This task focuses on building a strong foundation by understanding:
- CIA Triad
- Types of cyber attackers
- Attack surfaces
- OWASP Top 10
- Real-world application data flow

---

## 🔐 CIA Triad (Core Principles of Cyber Security)

### 1. Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible **only to authorized users**.

**Real-world examples:**
- Online banking credentials
- WhatsApp private messages
- Medical and personal records

**Security techniques used:**
- Encryption
- Authentication (passwords, MFA)
- Access control

---

### 2. Integrity
Integrity ensures that data remains **accurate and unaltered** during storage or transmission.

**Real-world examples:**
- Bank balances not being changed illegally
- Academic marks stored correctly

**Security techniques used:**
- Hashing
- Digital signatures
- Checksums

---

### 3. Availability
Availability ensures that systems and data are **accessible whenever required**.

**Real-world examples:**
- Banking apps during transactions
- Email services running 24/7

**Threats to availability:**
- DDoS attacks
- Server failures
- Ransomware attacks

---

## 🧑‍💻 Types of Cyber Attackers

### Script Kiddies
- Beginners using ready-made tools
- Limited technical knowledge
- Attack for curiosity or fun

---

### Insiders
- Employees or trusted individuals
- Abuse legitimate access
- Difficult to detect

---

### Hacktivists
- Politically or socially motivated
- Target governments or organizations
- Aim to spread awareness or protest

---

### Nation-State Actors
- Government-sponsored attackers
- Highly skilled and well funded
- Target critical infrastructure and sensitive data

---

## 🎯 What is an Attack Surface?

An **attack surface** is the total number of points where an attacker can attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system or data.

A larger attack surface increases security risk, while a smaller one is easier to protect.

---

## 🌐 Common Attack Surfaces

### Web Applications
- Login forms
- APIs
- Databases  
**Example attacks:** SQL Injection, XSS

---

### Mobile Applications
- Insecure data storage
- Weak authentication mechanisms

---

### APIs
- Broken authentication
- Excessive data exposure

---

### Networks
- Open ports
- Weak firewall rules
- Misconfigured routers

---

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Public storage buckets
- Weak IAM policies
- Misconfigured services

---

## 🔟 OWASP Top 10

OWASP Top 10 is a list of the **most critical web application security vulnerabilities**.

Common vulnerabilities include:
- SQL Injection
- Broken Authentication
- Security Misconfiguration
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Design

### Why OWASP Top 10 is Important:
- Industry-standard security reference
- Helps developers and security teams prioritize risks
- Reduces common security flaws in applications

---

## 📱 Mapping Daily Applications to Attack Surfaces

### Email Applications
- Phishing emails
- Malware attachments

### Messaging Applications (WhatsApp)
- Account takeover
- Malicious links

### Banking Applications
- Credential theft
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks

## 🧠 Summary (In My Own Words)

Cyber security focuses on protecting data and systems using the CIA triad principles.  
Understanding attackers, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities such as those listed in OWASP Top 10 helps identify weak points in applications.  
Securing each stage of data flow reduces the chances of cyber attacks and improves overall system security.
